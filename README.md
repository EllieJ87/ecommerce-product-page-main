# Ranger Game Website

This is a website that I created for my second milestone project. My personal admiration for gaming and storytelling made this website possible.

The concept for this game was influenced by the PS5 game Ratchet and Clank (disclaimer at the end), this was a huge game for me when I was younger. I also had a lot of inspiration from text adventure gaming (some independent and some more mainstream gaming)

I wanted to create a fun and interactive text adventure game where the player could choose their own options and have a different ending depending on the choices that they had picked.

The main narrator guides your through the journey, but it is up to you to have the final decision!

## <a name="researchtheme">Research</a>

To understand my text adventure game concept, I researched existing renditions of a simple text adventure game, which game me insight and help to be able to build and expanding with my own design and storytelling concept.

## <a name="designtheme">Design</a>

### <a name="themespace">Theme</a>

I have chosen a ‘space’ theme for my text adventure game. The main inspiration came from playing ‘Ratchet and Clank’ and I wanted to create a concept that was a mission based by calling on ‘rangers’ that were within the area.

With the space theme I researched imagery / colours to help building the fonts, colours and imagery used.

### <a name="fontsused">Fonts</a>

I have chosen [Orbiton](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Orbitron?query=orb) for the main title, copyright and main headers which are all in uppercase. I wanted an easy-to-read font that also had a space feel to it.

![Orbiton Text](assets/readme_docs/moodboard/orbiton-text.jpg)

For my main paragraph text, I have used [Sarpanch](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sarpanch?query=Sarpanch) I wanted to have a generic text that was still inspired by the space theme.

![Sarpanch Text](assets/readme_docs/moodboard/sarpanch-text.jpg)

### <a name="coloursused">Colours</a>

I wanted my colours not to be dark, I wanted to have clear pop of colours to bring a brightness to the screen. I did not want my main background to be black but rather a deep Navy colour.

My original concept was to have a main background colour with white text and one or two additional colours, however from research space imager of galaxies and Milky Way a lot of these colours have right yellows, greens, and purples.

With this research I choose to have a deep navy with a grey/white, mainly for readability on text, this is then mixed with a deep and bright purple and two additional accent colours of a bright teal and yellow colour.

These are the final chosen colour palette

![Colour Palette](assets/readme_docs/moodboard/colour-palette.jpg)

I feel these colours compliment each other and brings a very bright and engaging colours, in keeping with the users’ expectations.

### <a name="imageryused">Imagery</a>

The background image was drawn and coloured by me it was inspired by my space imagery research. I initially wanted it to be plain however I wanted something that would capture the space feel a bit more, so by the additional stars added to this feature nicely. The colours used in the background are used from the colour palette so there are no additional colours been added.

The main character inspiration was inspired by ‘Ratchet’ from ‘Ratchet and Clank’ this was researched and drawn together by me. He has multiple expressions and moods this is to help the user become engaged with him more.

Along with the main character there is some additional scenery to help the user see what they would expect to see when they are at that particular point at the game, this being either a meteor field, another space ship or distance space.

![Moodboard](assets/readme_docs/moodboard/moodboard-img.jpg)

All imagery that has been used has been drawn and developed by me this is because I wanted to not rely on other works as I had a clear vision on what I wanted each imagery to represent through this text adventure journey.

### <a name="storyplan">Story</a>

With the story having multiple options and several different endings I built a road map to all multiple options that each play can take! These are all based on what options you pick throughout the game and can impact either your Fuel, Ammo and Health bars.

Please note the story is my own concept and ideas please do not copy this as it took me a while to produce it.

### <a name="wireframesboards">Wireframes</a>

The wireframes were created using [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html) and the imagery can be found in the wireframes in pdf format.

There are some differences between my wireframes and my final website. This was due to visual preferences and what was able to work for a streamline user experience.

### <a name="wireframechange">Changes to Wireframes</a>

The wireframes haven't been changes as there were minimal changes but the actual site that has been produced as the final outcome shows these changes.

Some changes from the wireframes to the final live site were to resolve bugging issues layout did not work or there were issues to ensure the user full accessibility to the site.

## <a name="featuressite">Features</a>

This section is a brief highlight of features that this site contains, why they are the way they are as well as any future improvements or additions that would take this site from strength to strength.

### <a name="backgroundfeatures">Background</a>

- Takes up the full width of the screen and is centred with no repeat.
- This is sized according to the size of the device

### <a name="footerfeatures">Footer</a>

- Contains the copyright text, this is in the right side of the page this then is centred and on top of the navigation links in smaller screens for easy readability.
- Contains the 'Audio', 'Home', 'Contact', ‘Question’ (How to Play), ‘LinkedIn’ and ‘GitHub’ navigation links on the left side of the page and evenly spaced these and then stacked underneath the header title, these are all centred to the width of the screen
- All navigation links have an animation and a colour change when the user hover over the icon, this is so the user knows they are interactive and have a purpose
- The ‘LinkedIn’ and ‘GitHub’ icons opens a new window to the relevant page
- The footer runs along and is fixed at the bottom with no fill colour to make this easy to read and visual appealing
- The colour scheme is to be reflective of the colour palette and to be easy to see

### <a name="welcomemodal">Onload ‘Welcome Aboard’ (Modal)</a>

- Launches on the page load, this is central to the screen width and height.
- ‘Welcome Aboard’ header text is central to the modal
- Main mission for the game is central of the modal
- Input field is at the bottom of the modal where the player can input the name they wish to proceed with in the game, this is then linked to the main script game text and will be referenced back to this input
- Input field has validation on so the user needs to have a value inputted otherwise the game will not be able to proceed
- The ‘Descend’ button is next to the input field and enables the player to proceed to play the game
- User is unable to click outside of the modal box to dismiss it

### <a name="audioicon">Audio Icon</a>

- Situated in the bottom left side of the screen within the footer enables the player to toggle between having the audio on or off while playing the game
- When user clicks the ‘Audio’ icon the icon changes between volume on or off, this is clear to the user if sound is present or not
- When the sound is on all buttons have a 'click' noise when the user clicks on a button

### <a name="maingameplay">Game Play</a>

- Main container is situated in the centre of the screen, this has four different containers
- Main container has elements from bootstrap and grid layout to make this easier to be responsive
- Image container – displays an image depending on what option they are on making the game more visual engaging
- Text container – displays the text so the user knows how the story is progressing
- Option container – this holds the button options to move the user along to the next scene, these stay the same size regardless of how much text the button holds – options where carefully thought to not be too descriptive and to be clear and concise options for the users experience
- State container – holds additional element where the user knows how much fuel or ammo the user holds to add an extra element to the user
- All main container points are pulled from the script.js file to correctly display the correct progress point in the game
- The back click and back button has been disabled to prevent the player from going back in the game, the only way to ‘reset’ the game is to click the home button, this was to prevent the player from amending their options and trying to change their option

### <a name="howtoplaymodal">How to Play (Modal)</a>

- The ‘Question mark’ icon launches a modal once the user clicks on it
- This modal is centre to the screen width and height for full visibility
- This opens a ‘How to Play’ overlay where the user can read how to play the text adventure game and the objective of the game
- There is a ‘Ready’ button at the bottom of the screen, when the user clicks on the button this will take you back to the main page where the user had originally clicked on
- The user has the option to click outside of the box to dismiss the overlay
- The 'How to Play' text is also incorporated in the main game play if the user has missed this element, this can be skipped if the user does not want to go through this

**Feedback**

For the ‘How to Play’ instructions for the game play was suggested to try and see if this modal could be added into the ‘Welcome Modal’ prior to the game starting.

From this feedback I tried to implement this into the ‘Welcome Modal’ however there were difficulties regarding the closures of the modal as the ‘How to Play’ returned to where the game was and was not linking back to the ‘Welcome Modal’. As the ‘Welcome Modal’ is a crucial part of the game as it runs validations for the Players name, I felt adding this styling was not working for my set-up.

I later discussed this feedback with my mentor Sunny and he said as it’s not a timed based game then it was okay not to be added into the ‘Welcome Modal’. I also stated that the ‘How to Play’ instructions were also implemented into the game so the user can choose whether or not they wish to run through these or not when playing at the start.

### <a name="contactmodal">Contact (Modal)</a>

- The ‘Email’ icon launches a modal once the user clicks on it
- This modal is centre to the screen width and height for full visibility
- This opens the ‘Contact Me’ modal where the user has the option to send me feedback regarding their experience or general enquires that they wish to share
- This has input field for: Name, Email and Message to be filled out
- Name and Email have field has validation as this needs to be filled before the ‘Submit’ button is clicked
- Once this has been sent the user receives confirmation via an alert that the information has been submitted and the window closes
- The modal has a ‘Reset’ button where the user can click to clear the form if they wish
- If the user decides not to contact me when they have clicked the ‘Email’ icon there is an option ‘X’ button in the top right-hand corner, so they have to option to dismiss the overlay box
- The modal dismiss is also added so the user can click outside of the modal if they do not wish to submit a form

**_Updated:25-11-2021_**

- After feedback with Mentor regarding the validation for this it was decided for this feature to be temporarily removed.
- I will come back to this validation error when I have a bit more time to develop this feature more.
- See the testing documentation for the issues related to this feature

### <a name="homemodal">Home (Modal)</a>

- After reviewing the site, I felt it was needed to add a ‘Home’ icon option in case the user wished to reset the game or return back to the original onload screen
- When the ‘Home’ icon is clicked this opens a modal dialogue box, this is placed centrally in the window screen
- This has a brief description on why the user wishes to return back to the original onload screen
- When the user clicks on the ‘Home’ button the modal and full game will be removed
- A container is visible with an image, text and a refresh icon, this gives a brief description on an alternative ending
- A ‘Refresh’ icon will be visible for the use to click and will then refresh the page and takes the user back to the onload screen
- The 'Refresh' icon also holds an animation and text change which is in keeping to the other icons on the site

### <a name="endofgame">End of Game</a>

- The end of the game will have the game container removed from the screen and plain text with the final scenario visible
- This will have a option to ‘Play Again?’ which will refresh the page and take the user back to the onload screen where they can go back through the text adventure game again and try to find an alternative ending
  Future features
- I would like to have a share link where the user can share their experience and their ending with their friends via a social media platform
- I would like to add the battle element more where this becomes a mini in game experience
- I would like to have some navigation as a mini in game where the user needs to use the keyboard or their screen to control the space craft
- With these two options I would then like to implement a high score tracker where they can beat how quickly they can navigate through this mini challenge.

## <a name="technologies">Technologies Used</a>

[Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html)

- Adobe Photoshop was used to resize images and copyright all files. This was also to amend banner colours.

[Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html)

- was used for my works and drawings.

[Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html)

- I've used Adobe XD to create wireframes of my website before building the actual site.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

- The project uses the Bootstrap framework to add a responsive grid system, prebuilt components, plugins built on jQuery, and Bootstrap styles to my game, before adding my own custom styling

[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

- The project uses CSS to apply the custom styles to create the look of my game. The index.html file is linked directly to the main.css stylesheet

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7/)

- The project uses Font Awesome icons for all navigation and social media links that feature in the header and footer of my site

Google Chrome Dev Tools

- For testing purposes for responsive design

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)

- Google fonts was used to import ‘Orbiton font and ‘Sarpanch’ into the HTML which is used on all pages throughout the project.

[HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

- The project uses HTML to create the basic elements and content of my game

[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

- The project uses JavaScript from my custom script.js file to add functionality and interactivity to my text adventure game. This is the core focus of this project. The project also uses JavaScript from Bootstrap which is required to add functionality to the Bootstrap modal

[jQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery)

- The project uses jQuery to simplify DOM manipulation. This is both the standard jQuery that is built with Bootstrap components, and my custom jQuery used in my index.html and script.js files

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

- I used Visual Studio Code as the development environment to write the code for my website

[Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io)

- I used Autoprefixer to assist in ensuring my CSS code was compatible across all browsers

[Compressjpeg](https://compressjpeg.com)

- I used Compressjpeg to ensure all my visuals were compressed to ensure loading speeds were efficient

[Formspree](https://formspree.io)

- I used Formspree for the backend contact form to ensure this linked from my site to my direct email

[Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com)

- I used Zapsplat for the button sound of my game

### <a name="versioncontrol">Version Control</a>

[Git](https://git-scm.com)

- I've used Git as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to project in Visual Studio Code, before pushing them to GitHub.

[GitHub](https://github.com)

- I've used GitHub as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my website in a live environment.

## <a name="testingcases">Testing</a>

Testing can be found [here](https://github.com/EllieJ87/ranger-game/blob/master/Testing.md)

## <a name="implementationtest">Implementation</a>

As this is my first time building a fully responsive website, so coding and using Git was very new to me, trying to identify and resolve why issues were happening was a long process to fully understand and resolve. I do like to problem solve and research different methods to try and resolve the issues that I was facing. To do this I would mainly use Dev Tools in Google Chrome. By using elements of Bootstrap, mainly for the modals and to have prefixed padding, the main site was built using css grid and this was a new styling feature for me to learn. Understand how to manipulate the grid elements and to set this based on different screen sizes was very interesting to learn and understand the concept behind it. When testing I would use a combination of removing elements style by style to fully understand what this was targeting and how these effected the style and page layouts, this enable me to see what worked and did not work to my required aesthetic.

## <a name="deploymentsite">Deployment</a>

The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:

- Loaded the terminal window in my visual studio code workspace
- Initialised Git using the Source Control in the control panel
- Files that have been amended are automatically listed in the ‘Source Control’ panel
- Add message in the ‘Message’ section, making sure the commits are clear and concise (re-checked previous commits for layout and what was fixed / still pending)
- Click the ‘tick’ icon which stored the files in visual studio code
- Click the ‘ellipsis’ icon and select the ‘push’ option
- This then push all files and commits to the main branch
- This will add the updated files into the ‘main branch’ option under the ‘GitHub pages’ section
- Ran several commits after testing was carried out throughout my project.

### <a name="repositorylink">Repository Link</a>

The bulk of content on this site has been written by me in order to give the website information, purpose and meaning. I have spent many months in preparation for this website ensuring there is enough diverse content and that all has a similar hand styling and theme.

## <a name="acknowledgmentsthanks">Acknowledgments</a>

Firstly, I would like to thank my Mentor Sunny Hebbar for honest, helpful and continuous feedback, without this I wouldn’t have been able to push myself, giving me helpful sites to understand JavaScript more. Sunny has been absolutely superb to work with! I really enjoy our mentor sessions together and can't thank Sunny enough for all the help and support that has been given to me. Thank you again, I really appreciate all your help and support.

I would like to also thank my brother Sam Judge who has helped me isolate problems and solve elements one by one to help manage my time and problem solving, this has helped me keep myself focussed. He has also help support me when the times have been very tough and times of uncertainty of my capabilities.

I would also like to thank the [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/) Community for helping me fix issues and errors.

I promise one day I will revisit this site once I have finished this course to keep pushing the limits to further add new exciting elements to this project to go above and beyond!
